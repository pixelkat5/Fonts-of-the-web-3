# Fonts-of-the-web-3
I really like graphic design and products by ATLUS and P-Studio. For me, P-Studio is a gateway to seeing what the world of Japanese graphic design is like. If you haven't ever seen what the Japanese internet looks like, look up a comparison Its rather charming in a way. ANYWAYS this is just gonna be where I put font files from things I come across.
